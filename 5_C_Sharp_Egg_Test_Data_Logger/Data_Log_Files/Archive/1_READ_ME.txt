The data in here is formatted in such a way DATA_<Min>_<Filter data points>_<Data set>.
Min - the number of minutes cooked, however, it is not really correct because the method of boiling them
	is inconsistent, I do not recommend trusting these numbers.
Filter data points - the number of data points that was used to average the data. The arduino performed 
	a moving average.
Data set - The nth data set for a particular experiment. I usually tested each egg 5 times, hence 1 to 5.
